Hello I'm EtherealLogic, Currently a roblox game dev working on a solo project. 
Though I believe roblox dev can be lackluster sometimes so I like to switch to some C++ and OpenGl stuff from time to time. 
I'd be happy to meet some new people to do some roblox Dev work with or maybe even learn more OpenGL/C++!
